Gruepr notes 02/26/2024:
- Figure out how to properly abstract API communication within code
- API communication includes:
	- export survey page after survey creation
	- import survey page to import and create groups
	- create "canvas teams" (only for canvas API)
- Where to create .h and .cpp files for API communication abstraction?
- Bring these things up with Josh tomorrow (27th) at 12...
